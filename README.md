Cameroon Budget Transparency
============================

This project covers efforts to make budgetary documents from a range of regions 
in Cameroon accessible and understandable to political decision makers in the
country and to members of the international community. 

Datasets in this repository:

* `investment_budget` has the national project investment budget. The data was
  extracted from PDFs and is unusable in its current state. 
* `north_west` is the budget of the north-west region. it has some rough overview
  of the total budget but also lays out investments per administrative division 
  in some detail. It has been processed in Refine to make the investments part 
  into a full, denormalized dataset.
* `transparency_index` contains survey data collected from some municipalities 
  in the north-west region on how transparent and accountable the distribution of
  funds is handled in their communities. It also contains some scans of the 
  actual surveys. 
* `local_councils` has budgets from some of the local councils and some data that
  still needs to be cleaned up. 
* `shapefiles` is a collection of map files from the GADM.org site and a joint 
  project by GIZ and the government of Cameroon.
